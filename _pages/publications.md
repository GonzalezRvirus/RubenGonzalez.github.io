<span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; color: #1280CD;">14</span>•**Natural monobacterial environments modulate viral infection in *Caenorhabditis elegans*** <br/>
González R†; Félix M-A†<br/>
bioRxiv [PREPRINT]. 
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.13.544807)
<br/> 
<small> We discovered that most natural bacteria significantly reduced host susceptibility to the virus compared to a non-natural bacterial environment commonly used in research. Intriguingly, several bacteria induced resistance to infection without degrading virions or providing poor nutrition. Furthermore, we found that these resistance-inducing bacteria did not act through known antiviral responses in the host; however, some bacteria fail to induce the resistance in animals with a hampered DRH-1, a RIG-1 homolog. </small>
