González R; Butković A; Escaray F; Martínez-Latorre J; Melero I; Pérez-Parets E; Gómez-Cadenas A; Carrasco P; Elena SF†. (2021)<br/>
**Plant virus evolution under strong drought conditions results in a transition from parasitism to mutualism.**<br/> 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 118, e2020990118.
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2020990118)<br/> 
<small>This work shows that if the environment endangers the host, viruses can evolve to provide a host increased tolerance to the adverse conditions.</small></p>

Butkovic A; González R; Cobo I; Elena, SF†. (2020)<br/>
**Adaptation of turnip mosaic potyvirus to a specific niche reduces its genetic and environmental robustness.**<br/> 
Virus evolution. 6, veaa041.
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa041)<br/> 
<small>This work shows that viruses highly adapted to their host are more sensitive to random mutations and temperature conditions than non-adapted viruses. </small></p>
<hr/>
González R†^; Butković A^; Elena SF†. (2020)<br/>
**From foes to friends: viral infections expand the limits of host phenotypic plasticity.**<br/>
Advances in Virus Research. 106, 85-121.
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2020.01.003)<br/> 
<small>Review of works showing how viruses can alter their host phenotypic plasticity so they can survive in the face of unpredictable environmental stress.</small></p>
<hr/>
González R; Butković A; Elena SF†. (2019)<br/>
**Role of host genetic diversity for susceptibility-to-infection in the evolution of virulence of a plant virus.**<br/> 
Virus evolution. 5, vez024. 
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vez024)<br/> 
<small>This work illustrates how the genetic diversity of hosts in an ecosystem affects virus adaptation, as viruses specialized faster in homogeneous populations but were more pathogenic in heterogeneous ones.</small></p>

González R^; Wu B^; Li X; Martínez F†; Elena SF†. (2019)<br/> 
**Mutagenesis scanning uncovers evolutionary constraints on tobacco etch potyvirus membrane-associated 6K2 protein.**<br/>

[Honourable Mention in Best Student Paper Awards for papers published in 2019 in GBE](https://www.smbe.org/smbe/HOME/TabId/37/ArtMID/1395/ArticleID/94/Congratulations-to-the-winners-of-the-SMBE-2020-Best-Student-Paper-Awards-for-papers-published-in-2019-in-MBE-and-GBE.aspx)<br/> 
<small>This study unveils the evolutionary constraints on a 6K2 potyviral protein, with an evolutionary tradeoff between within-host accumulation and severity of symptoms.</small></p>

Rolán-Alvarez E†; Carvajal-Rodríguez A; de Coo A; Cortés B; Estévez D; Ferreira M; González R; Briscoe AD. (2015)<br/> 
**The scale-of-choice effect and how estimates of assortative mating in the wild can be biased due to heterogeneous samples.**<br/> 
Evolution. 69, 1845–1857. 
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12691)<br/> 
<small>This work suggest that the low frequency of negative assortative mating observed in the literature may be due to the investigator's sampling simple.</small></p>
