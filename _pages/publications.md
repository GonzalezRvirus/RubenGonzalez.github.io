<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">
My research investigates the fundamental principles governing host-pathogen interactions across model systems. By integrating evolutionary biology, molecular virology, and systems approaches, we uncover how viruses evolve, impact host biology, and interact with environmental factors to shape infection outcomes.

Gonz√°lez R; Castell√≥-Sanu√°n M; Saleh M-C‚Ä†<br/>
*BioRXiv* (PREPRINT)<br/>
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.13.643076)<br/>
<small>We found that (i) enteric viral infections accelerate aging, (ii) even if the infection is cleared, aging process remains triggered, and (iii) accelerated aging correlates with reduced lifespan.</small>

### Host Development & Viral Interactions

**Transcriptional and hormonal profiling uncovers the interactions between plant developmental stages and RNA virus infection** (2024)<br/>
Melero I; G√≥mez-Cadenas A; Gonz√°lez R‚Ä†; Elena SF‚Ä†<br/>
*Journal of General Virology* 105, 002023<br/>
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.002023)<br/>
<small>In late-stage infections, plants downregulate cell wall biosynthetic genes to facilitate viral spread but exhibit higher fertility. Salicylic acid boosts resistance while reducing seed production, revealing a developmental trade-off between viral susceptibility and reproductive success.</small>

[Read here](https://doi.org/10.17912/micropub.biology.000943)<br/>
<small>Our findings suggest that the past adaptation history of the ancestral viral strain influences its future evolution, and each plant developmental stage imposes unique selective constraints on virus evolution</small>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #1280CD; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

### Microbiome Effects

**Natural monobacterial environments modulate viral infection in *Caenorhabditis elegans*** (2024)<br/>
Gonz√°lez R‚Ä†; F√©lix M-A‚Ä†<br/>
*PLoS Pathogens* 20, e1011947<br/>
[Read here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011947)<br/>
<small>We discovered that most natural bacteria significantly reduced host susceptibility to the virus compared to a non-natural bacterial environment commonly used in research. Intriguingly, several bacteria induced resistance to infection without degrading virions or providing poor nutrition. Furthermore, we found that these resistance-inducing bacteria did not act through known antiviral responses in the host; however, some bacteria fail to induce the resistance in animals with a hampered DRH-1, a RIG-1 homolog.</small>
