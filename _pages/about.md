Currently, I am a predoctoral researcher in the [laboratory](https://sfelenalab.csic.es) of Professor Santiago F. Elena. My research focuses on the genetic and ecological implications of viral evolution, studying viruses as complex adaptive systems and using *Arabidopsis thaliana* as host. We carry on our research at the Institute for Integrative Systems Biology [(IÂ²SysBio)](https://www.uv.es/institute-integrative-systems-biology-i2sysbio/en/institute-integrative-systems-biology-i-sysbio.html)
