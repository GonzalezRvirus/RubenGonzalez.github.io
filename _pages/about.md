I am a scientist focused on the study of host-virus interactions and their evolutionary dynamics. My research aims to elucidate the complex interplay between host, virus, and microbial communities, and how these interactions shape the outcomes of viral infections.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of Vigo (Spain) and later pursued a Master's degree in Plant Molecular and Cellular Biotechnology at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain). It was during my Master that Professor [Santiago F. Elena](https://sfelenalab.csic.es/sfelena/) introduced me to the captivating field of virus research. Following this experience, I decided to pursue a PhD under his mentorship at the I2SysBio, focusing on factors that influence the evolution of viruses, using plant-pathogen systems as model organisms.

After my PhD, I obtained an [EMBO](https://www.embo.org/about-embo/mission/) Postdoctoral Fellowship and joined the [Marie-Anne Félix Laboratory](https://www.ibens.ens.fr/?rubrique29&lang=en) (IBENS, France). There I investigated host factors and bacterial environments that modulate the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* susceptibility to Orsay virus infection.

Currently, I am postdoctoral researcher at [Carla Saleh Laboratory](http://salehlab.eu) (Institut Pasteur, France). In here I am a happy researcher studying viral infections in the fly *Drosophila melanogaster*. My research here focuses in the aging induced by viruses and the impact of the microbiome in infections and the evolution of viruses.
