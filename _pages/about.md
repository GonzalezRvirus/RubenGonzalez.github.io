Currently, I am a predoctoral researcher under the supervision of Professor [Santiago F. Elena](https://sfelenalab.csic.es/sfelena/).<br/> The focus of my research are the genetic and ecological implications in viral evolution and the study of viruses as complex adaptive systems in the host *Arabidopsis thaliana*.<br/>We are situated at the Institute for Integrative Systems Biology [(I²SysBio)](https://www.uv.es/institute-integrative-systems-biology-i2sysbio/en/institute-integrative-systems-biology-i-sysbio.html)
