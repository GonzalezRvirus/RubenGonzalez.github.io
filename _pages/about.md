<hr/>
I am an evolutionary biologist that studies viruses as complex adaptive systems. 
<br/>
<br/>Currently I am a predoctoral researcher mentored by Professor [Santiago F. Elena](https://sfelenalab.csic.es/sfelena/). After my thesis defense I will continue my reserch on the team of Professor [Marie-Anne Félix](https://www.ibens.ens.fr/?rubrique29&lang=en) <br/>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      The focus of my research is the genetic and ecological implications of viral evolution. Experimental evolution. 
      My main scientific interest is in understanding evolutionary processes while integrating molecular and physiological mechanisms. The focus of my research is the experimental evolution of viruses.

I am particularly interested in viruses as they allow us to address evolutionary questions quite rapidly. After my research on plant viruses, I aim to use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>-Orsay virus pathosystem, which will allow me to address my current research interests and will surely foster new ones.
